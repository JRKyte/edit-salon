                  p.small-text Hairdressing has always been my passion as I feel we make people feel good about themselves and they leave feeling extra special. I am looking forward to learning new cutting techniques because of the precision which goes into every cut. I would love the opportunity to cut short styles including pixie cuts or short sharp bobs. My favourite product which I would always rely on in salon would be 'oil for all' its lightweight, can be used on wet or dry and it can be used on any type of hair!
